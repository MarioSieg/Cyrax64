# CyraxOS 64

Small bootloader, kernel and OS for learning, hacking and experimenting.<br>
The 64-bit version of my little experimantal OS inspired by TempleOS.<br>
Written in C and assembly for the x86-64 architecture.<br>
I'm working on it from time to time, feel free to contribute!<br>

To run it, first run InstallDeps.sh with root privileges.<br>
This will install gcc and qemu-system-x86, if not already installed.<br>
With all prerequisites installed, just run make run to compile and run the OS.<br>
